coarser realities of life when she died she left theodoric alone in a world that was as real as ever and a good deal coarser than he considered it had any need to be to a man of his temperament and upbringing even a simple railway journey was crammed with petty annoyances and minor discords and as he settled himself down in a secondclass compartment one september morning he was conscious of ruffled feelings and general mental discomposure he had been staying at a country vicarage the inmates of which had been certainly neither brutal nor bacchanalian but their supervision of the domestic establishment had been of that lax order which invites disaster the pony carriage that was to take him to the station had never been properly ordered and when the moment for his departure drew near the handyman who should have produced the required article was nowhere to be found in this emergency theodoric to his mute but very intense disgust found himself obliged to collaborate with the vicars daughter in the task of harnessing the pony which necessitated groping about in an illlighted outbuilding called a stable and  melling very like oneexcept in patches where it smelled of mice without being actually afraid of mice theodoric classed them among the coarser incidents of life and considered that providence with a little exercise of moral courage might long ago have recognized that they were not indispensable and have withdrawn them from circulation as the train glided out of the station theodorics nervous imagination accused himself of exhaling a weak odor of stable yard and possibly of displaying a moldy straw or two on his unusually wellbrushed garments fortunately the only other occupation of the compartment a lady of about the same age as himself seemed inclined for slumber rather than scrutiny the train was not due to stop till the terminus was reached in about an hours time and the carriage was of the oidfashioned sort that held no communication with a corridor therefore no further traveling companions were likely to intrude on theodorics semiprivacy and yet the train had scarcely attained its normal speed before he became reluctantly but vividly aware that he was not alone with the slumbering lady he was not even alone in his own clothes a warm creeping movement over his flesh betrayed the unwelcome and highly resented presence unseen but poignant of a strayed mouse that had evidently dashed into its present retreat during the episode of the pony harnessing furtive stamps and shakes and wildly directed pinches failed to dislodge the intruder whose motto indeed seemed to be excelsior and the lawful occupant of the clothes lay back against the cushions and endeavored rapidly to evolve some means for putting an end to the dual ownership it was unthinkable that he should continue for the space of a whole hour in the horrible position of a rowton house for vagrant mice already his imagination had at least doubled the numbers of the alien invasion on the other hand nothing less drastic than partial disrobing would ease him of his tormentor and to undress in the presence of a lady even for so laudable a purpose was an idea that made his ear tips tingle in a blush of abject shame he had never heen able to bring himself even to the mild exposure of openwork socks in the presence of the fair sex and yetthe lady in this case was to all appearances soundly and securely asleep the mouse on the other hand seemed to be trying to crowd a wanderjahr into a few strenuous minutes if there is any truth in the theory of transmigration this particular mouse must certainly have been in a former state a member of the alpine club sometimes in its eagerness it lost its footing and slipped for half an inch or so and then in fright or more probably temper it bit theodoric was goaded into the most audacious undertaking of his life crimsoning to the hue of a beetroot and keeping an agonized watch on his slumbering fellow traveler he swiftly and noiselessly secured the ends of his railway rug to the racks on either side of the carriage so that a substantial curtain hung athwart the compartment in the narrow dressing room that he had thus improvised he proceeded with violent haste to extricate himself partially and the mouse entirely from the surrounding casings of tweed and halfwool as the unraveled mouse gave a wild leap to the floor the rug slipping its fastening at either end also came down with a heartcurdling flop and almost simultaneously the awakened sleeper opened her eyes with a movement almost quicker than the mouses theodoric pounced on the rug and hauled its ample folds chinhigh over his dismantled person as he collapsed into the farther corner of the carriage the blood raced and beat in the veins of his neck and forehead while he waited dumbly for the communication cord to be pulled the lady however contented herself with a silent stare at her strangely muffled companion how much had she seen theodoric queried to himself and in any case what on earth must she think of his present posture"

out into it across the court a figure shaped itself in the tapering perspective of bare lines it looked a mere blot of deeper gray in the grayness and for an instant as it moved toward her her heart thumped to the thought its the ghostshe had time in that long instant to feel suddenly that the man of whom two months earlier she had a brief distant vision from the roof was now at his predestined hour about to reveal himself as not having been peters and her spirit sank under the impending fear of the disclosure but almost with the next tick of the clock the ambiguous figure gaining substance and character showed itself even to her weak sight as her husbands and she turned away to meet him as he entered with the confession of her follyits really too absurd she laughed out from the threshold but i never can rememberremember what boyne questioned as they drew togetherthat when one sees the lyng ghost one never knows ither hand was on his sleeve and he kept it there but with no response in his gesture or in the lines of his fagged preoccupied facedid you think youd seen it he asked after an appreciable intervalwhy i actually took you for it my dear in my mad determination to spot itme  just now his arm dropped away and he turned from her with a faint echo of her laugh really dearest youd better give it up if thats the best you can doyes i give it up  i give it up have you

insisted when the servant had disappeared on her errand of illuminationhave i what he rejoined absently the light bringing out the sharp stamp of worry between his brows as he turned over the lettersgiven up trying to see the ghost her heart beat a little at the experiment she was makingher husband laying his letters aside moved away into the shadow of the hearthi never tried he said tearing open the wrapper of a newspaperwell of course mary persisted the exasperating thing is that theres no use trying since one cant be sure till so long afterwardhe was unfolding the paper as if he had hardly heard her but after a pause during which the sheets rustled spasmodically between his hands he lifted his head to say abruptly have you any idea how longmary had sunk into a low chair beside the fireplace from her seat she looked up startled at her husbands profile which was darkly projected against the circle of lamplightno none have you she retorted repeating her former phrase with an added keenness of intentionboyne crumpled the paper into a bunch and then inconsequently turned back with it toward the lamplord no i only meant he explained with a faint tinge of impatience is there any legend any tradition as to thatnot that i know of she answered but the impulse to add what makes you ask was checked by the reappearance of the parlor maid with tea and a second lampwith the dispersal of shadows and the repetition of the daily domestic office mary boyne felt herself less oppressed by that sense of something mutely imminent which had darkened her solitary afternoon for a few moments she gave herself silently to the details of her task and when she looked up from it she was struck to the point of bewilderment by the change in her husbands face he had seated himself near the farther lamp and was absorbed in the perusal of his letters but was it something he had found in them or merely the shifting of her own point of view that had restored his features to their normal aspect the longer she looked the more definitely the change affirmed itself the lines of painful tension had vanished and such traces of fatigue as lingered were of the kind easily attributable to steady mental effort he glanced up as if drawn by her gaze and met her eyes with a smileim dying for my tea you know and heres a letter for you he saidshe took the letter he held out in exchange for the cup she proffer him and returning to her seat broke the seal with the languid gesture of the reader whose interests are all inclosed in the circle of one cherished presenceher next conscious motion was that of starting to her feet the letter falling to them as she rose while she held out to her husband a long newspaper clippingned whats this what does it meanhe had risen at the same instant almost as if hearing her cry before she uttered it and for a perceptible space of time he and she studied each other like adversaries watching for an advantage across the space between her chair and his deskwhats what you fairly made me jump boyne said at length moving toward her with a sudden halfexasperated laugh the shadow of apprehension was on his face again not now a look of fixed foreboding but a shifting vigilance of lips and eyes that gave her the sense of his feeling himself invisibly surroundedher hand shook so that she could hardly give him the clippingthis article  from the waukesha sentinel  that a man named elwell has brought suit against you  that there was something wrong about the blue star mine i cant understand more than halfthey continued to face each other as she spoke and to her astonishment she saw that her words had the almost immediate effect of dissipating the strained watchfulness of his lookoh that he glanced down the printed slip and then folded it with the gesture of one who handles something harmless and familiar whats the matter with you this afternoon mary i thought youd got bad newsshe stood before him with her undefinable terror subsiding slowly under the reassuring touch of his composureyou knew about this then  its all rightcertainly i knew about it and its all rightbut what is it i dont understand what does this man accuse you ofoh pretty nearly every crime in the calendar boyne had tossed the clipping down and thrown himself comfortably into an armchair near the fire do you want to hear the story its not particularly interesting  just a squabble over interests in the blue starbut who is this elwell i dont know the nameoh hes a fellow i put into it  gave him a hand up i told you all about him at the timei daresay i must have forgotten vainly she strained back among her memories but if you helped him why does he make this returnoh probably some shyster lawyer got hold of him and talked him over its all rather technical and complicated i thought that kind of thing bored youhis wife felt a sting of compunction theoretically she deprecated the american wifes detachment from her husbands professional interests but in practice she had always found it difficult to fix her attention on boynes report of the transactions in which his varied interests involved him besides she had felt from the first that in a community where the amenities of living could be obtained only at the cost of efforts as arduous as her husbands professional labors such brief leisure as they could command should be used as an escape from immediate preoccupations a flight to the life they always dreamed of living once or twice now that this new life had actually drawn its magic circle about them she had asked herself if she had done right but hitherto such conjectures had been no more than the retrospective excursions of an active fancy now for the first time it startled her a little to find how little she knew of the material foundation on which her happiness was builtshe glanced again at her husband and was reassured by the composure of his face yet she felt the need of more definite grounds for her reassurancebut doesnt this suit worry you why have you never spoken to me about ithe answered both questions at once i didnt speak of it at first because it did worry me  annoyed me rather but its all ancient history now your correspondent must have got hold of a back number of the sentinelshe felt a quick thrill of relief you mean its over hes lost his casethere was a just perceptible delay in boynes reply the suits been withdrawn  thats allbut she persisted as if to exonerate herself from the inward charge of being too easily put off withdrawn because he saw he had no chanceoh he had no chance boyne answeredshe was still struggling with a dimly felt perplexity at the back of her thoughtshow long ago was it withdrawnhe paused as if with a slight return of his former uncertainty ive just had the news now but ive been expecting itjust now  in one of your lettersyes in one of my lettersshe made no answer and was aware only after a short interval of waiting that he had risen and strolling across the room had placed himself on the sofa at her side she felt him as he did so pass an arm about her she felt his hand seek hers and clasp it and turning slowly drawn by the warmth of his cheek she met the smiling clearness of his eyesits all right  its all right she questioned through the flood of her dissolving doubts and i give you my word it never was righter he laughed back at

its latent significance as she stood in the december dusk waiting for the lamps to be brought into the librarythe words had been spoken by their friend alida stair as they sat at tea on her lawn at pangbourne in reference to the very house of which the library in question was the central the pivotal feature mary boyne and her husband in quest of a country place in one of the southern or

capriciously several practical and judicious suggestions that she threw it out well theres lyng in dorsetshire it belongs to hugos cousins and you can get it for a songthe reasons she gave for its being obtainable on these terms  its remoteness from a station its lack of electric light hotwater pipes and other vulgar necessities  were exactly those pleading in its favor with two romantic americans perversely in search of the economic drawbacks which were associated in their tradition with unusual architectural felicitiesi should never believe i was living in an old house unless i was

numbered and set up again and they had proceeded to enumerate with humorous precision their various suspicions and exactions refusing to believe that the house their cousin recommended was really tudor till they learned it had no heating system or that the village church was literally in the grounds till she assured them of the deplorable uncertainty of the water supplyits too uncomfortable to be true edward boyne had continued to exult as the avowal of each disadvantage was successively wrung from her but he had cut short his rhapsody to ask with a sudden relapse to distrust and the ghost youve been concealing from us the fact that there is no ghostmary at the moment had laughed with him yet almost with her laugh being possessed of several sets of independent perceptions had noted a sudden flatness of tone in alidas answering hilarityoh dorsetshires full of ghosts you knowyes yes but that wont do i dont want to have to drive ten miles to see somebody elses ghost i want one of my own on the premises is there a ghost at lynghis rejoinder had made alida laugh again and it was then that she had flung back tantalizingly oh there is one of course but youll never know itnever know

till afterward at any ratetill afterwardnot till long long afterwardbut if its once been identified as an unearthly visitant why hasnt its signalement been handed down in the family how has it managed to preserve its incognitoalida could only shake her head dont ask me but it hasand then suddenly  mary spoke up as if from some cavernous depth of divination suddenly long afterward one says to ones self that was itshe was oddly startled at the sepulchral sound with which her question fell on the banter of the other two and she saw the shadow of the same surprise flit across alidas clear pupils i suppose so one just has to waitoh hang waiting ned broke in lifes too short for a ghost who can only be enjoyed in retrospect cant we do better than that marybut it turned out that in the event they were not destined to for within three months of their conversation with mrs stair they were established at lyng and the life they had yearned for to the point of planning it out in all its daily details had actually begun for themit was to sit in the thick december dusk by just such a widehooded fireplace under just such black oak rafters with the sense that beyond the mullioned panes the downs were darkening to a deeper solitude it was for the ultimate indulgence in such sensations that mary boyne had endured for nearly fourteen years the souldeadening ugliness of the middle west and that boyne had ground on doggedly at his engineering till with a suddenness that still made her blink the prodigious windfall of the blue star mine had put them at a stroke in possession of life and the leisure to taste it they had never for a moment meant their new state to be one of idleness but they meant to give themselves only to harmonious activities she had her vision of painting and gardening against a background of gray walls he dreamed of the production of his longplanned book on the economic basis of culture and with such absorbing work ahead no existence could be too sequestered they could not get far enough from the world or plunge deep enough into the pastdorsetshire had attracted them from the first by a semblance of remoteness out of all proportion to its geographical position but to the boynes it was one of the everrecurring wonders of the whole incredibly compressed island  a nest of counties as they put it  that for the production of its effects so little of a given quality went so far that so few miles made a distance and so short a distance a differenceits that ned had once enthusiastically explained that gives such depth to their effects such relief to their least contrasts theyve been able to lay the butter so thick on every exquisite mouthfulthe butter had certainly been laid on thick at lyng the old gray house hidden under a shoulder of the downs had almost all the finer marks of commerce with a protracted past the mere fact that it was neither large nor exceptional made it to the boynes abound the more richly in its special sense  the sense of having been for centuries a deep dim reservoir of life the life had probably not been of the most vivid order for long periods no doubt it had fallen as noiselessly into the past as the quiet drizzle of autumn fell hour after hour into the green fishpond between the yews but these backwaters of existence sometimes breed in their sluggish depths strange acuities of emotion and mary boyne had felt from the first the occasional brush of an intenser memorythe feeling had never been stronger than on the december afternoon when waiting in the library for the belated lamps she rose from her seat and stood among the shadows of the hearth her husband had gone off after luncheon for one of his long tramps on the downs she had noticed of late that he preferred to be unaccompanied on these occasions and in the tried security of their personal relations had been driven to conclude that his book was bothering him and that he needed the afternoons to turn over in solitude the problems left from the mornings work certainly the book was not going as smoothly as she had imagined it would and the lines of perplexity between his eyes had never been there in his engineering days then he had often looked fagged to the verge of illness but the native demon of worry had never branded his brow yet the few pages he had so far read to her  the introduction and a synopsis of the opening chapter  gave evidences of a firm possession of his subject and a deepening confidence in his powersthe fact threw her into deeper perplexity since now that he had done with business and its disturbing contingencies the one other possible element of anxiety was eliminated unless it were his health then but physically he had gained since they had come to dorsetshire grown robuster ruddier and freshereyed it was only within a week that she had felt in him the undefinable change that made her restless in his absence and as tonguetied in his presence as though it were she who had a secret to keep from himthe thought that there was a secret somewhere between them struck her with a sudden smart rap of wonder and she looked about her down the dim long roomcan it be the house she musedthe room itself might have been full of secrets they seemed to be piling themselves up as evening fell like the layers and layers of velvet shadow dropping from the low ceiling the dusky walls of books the smokeblurred sculpture of the hooded hearthwhy of course  the house is haunted she reflectedthe ghost  alidas imperceptible ghost  after figuring largely in the banter of their first month or two at lyng had been gradually discarded as too ineffectual for imaginative use mary had indeed as became the tenant of a haunted house made the customary inquiries among her few rural neighbors but beyond a vague they du say so maam the villagers had nothing to impart the elusive specter had apparently never had sufficient identity for a legend to crystallize about it and after a time the boynes had laughingly set the matter down to their profitandloss account agreeing that lyng was one of the few houses good enough in itself to dispense with supernatural enhancementsand i suppose poor ineffectual demon thats why it beats its beautiful wings in vain in the void mary had laughingly concludedor rather ned answered in the same strain why amid so much thats ghostly it can never affirm its separate existence as the ghost and thereupon their invisible housemate had finally dropped out of their references which were numerous enough to make them promptly unaware of the lossnow as she stood on the hearth the subject of their earlier curiosity revived in her with a new sense of its meaning  a sense gradually acquired through close daily contact with the scene of the lurking mystery it was the house itself of course that possessed the ghostseeing faculty that communed visually but secretly with its own past and if one could only get into close enough communion with the house one might surprise its secret and acquire the ghostsight on ones own account perhaps in his long solitary hours in this very room where she never trespassed till the afternoon her husband had acquired it already and was silently carrying the dread weight of whatever it had revealed to him mary was too wellversed in the code of the spectral world not to know that one could not talk about the ghosts one saw to do so was almost as great a breach of goodbreeding as to name a lady in a club but this explanation did not really satisfy her what after all except for the fun of the frisson she reflected would he really care for any of their old ghosts and thence she was thrown back once more on the fundamental dilemma the fact that ones greater or less susceptibility to spectral influences had no particular bearing on the case since when one did see a ghost at lyng one did not know itnot till long afterward alida stair had said well supposing ned had seen one when they first came and had known only within the last week what had happened to him more and more under the spell of the hour she threw back her searching thoughts to the early days of their tenancy but at first only to recall a gay confusion of unpacking settling arranging of books and calling to each other from remote corners of the house as treasure after treasure of their habitation revealed itself to them it was in this particular connection that she presently recalled a certain soft afternoon of the previous october when passing from the first rapturous flurry of exploration to a detailed inspection of the old house she had pressed like a novel heroine a panel that opened at her touch on a narrow flight of stairs leading to an unsuspected flat ledge of the roof  the roof which from below seemed to slope away on all sides too abruptly for any but practised feet to scalethe view from this hidden coign was enchanting and she had flown down to snatch ned from his papers and give him the freedom of her discovery she remembered still how standing on the narrow ledge he had passed his arm about her while their gaze flew to the long tossed horizonline of the downs and then dropped contentedly back to trace the arabesque of yew hedges about the fishpond and the shadow of the cedar on the lawnand now the other way he had said gently turning her about within his arm and closely pressed to him she had absorbed like some long satisfying draft the picture of the graywalled court the squat lions on the gates and the limeavenue reaching up to the highroad under the downsit was just then while they gazed and held each other that she had felt his arm relax and heard a sharp hullo that made her turn to glance at himdistinctly yes she now recalled she had seen as she glanced a shadow of anxiety of perplexity rather fall across his face and following his eyes had beheld the figure of a man  a man in loose grayish clothes as it appeared to her  who was sauntering down the limeavenue to the court with the tentative gait of a stranger seeking his way her shortsighted eyes had given her but a blurred impression of slightness and grayness with something foreign or at least unlocal in the cut of the figure or its garb but her husband had apparently seen more  seen enough to make him push past her with a sharp wait and dash down the twisting stairs without pausing to give her a hand for the descenta slight tendency to dizziness obliged her after a provisional clutch at the chimney against which they had been leaning to follow him down more cautiously and when she had reached the attic landing she paused again for a less definite reason leaning over the oak banister to strain her eyes through the silence of the brown sunflecked depths below she lingered there till somewhere in those depths she heard the closing of a door then mechanically impelled she went down the shallow flights of steps till she reached the lower hallthe front door stood open on the mild sunlight of the court and hall and court were empty the library door was open too and after listening in vain for any sound of voices within she quickly crossed the threshold and found her husband alone vaguely fingering the papers on his deskhe looked up as if surprised at her precipitate entrance but the shadow of anxiety had passed from his face leaving it even as she fancied a little brighter and clearer than usualwhat was it who was it she askedwho he repeated with the surprise still all on his sidethe man we saw coming toward the househe seemed honestly to reflect the man why i thought i saw peters i dashed after him to say a word about the stabledrains but he had disappeared before i could get downdisappeared why he seemed to be walking so slowly when we saw himboyne shrugged his shoulders so i thought but he must have got up steam in the interval what do you say to our trying a scramble up meldon steep before sunsetthat was all at the time the occurrence had been less than nothing had indeed been immediately obliterated by the magic of their first vision from meldon steep a height which they had dreamed of climbing ever since they had first seen its bare spine heaving itself above the low roof of lyng doubtless it was the mere fact of the other incidents having occurred on the very day of their ascent to meldon that had kept it stored away in the unconscious fold of association from which it now emerged for in itself it had no mark of the portentous at the moment there could have been nothing more natural than that ned should dash himself from the roof in the pursuit of dilatory tradesmen it was the period when they were always on the watch for one or the other of the specialists employed about the place always lying in wait for them and dashing out at them with questions reproach or reminders and certainly in the distance the gray figure had looked like petersyet now as she reviewed the rapid scene she felt her husbands explanation of it to have been invalidated by the look of anxiety on his face why had the familiar appearance of peters made him anxious why above all if it was of such prime necessity to confer with that authority on the subject of the stabledrains had the failure to find him produced such a look of relief mary could not say that any one of these considerations had occurred to her at the time yet from the promptness with which they now marshaled themselves at her summons she had a sudden sense that they must all along have been there waiting their hour"

            "Text": "all of a sudden she noticed that her beauty had fallen all apart on her that it had begun to pain her physically like a tumor or a cancer she still remembered the weight of the privilege she had borne over her body during adolescence which she had dropped nowwho knows wherewith the weariness of resignation with the final gesture of a declining creature it was impossible to bear that burden any longer she had to drop that useless attribute of her personality somewhere as she turned a corner somewhere in the outskirts or leave it behind on the coatrack of a secondrate restaurant like some old useless coat she was tired of being the center of attention of being under siege from mens long looks at night when insomnia stuck its pins into her eyes she would have liked to be an ordinary woman without any special attraction everything was hostile to her within the four walls of her room desperate she could feel her vigil spreading out under her skin into her head pushing the fever upward toward the roots of her hair it was as if her arteries had become peopled with hot tiny insects who with the approach of dawn awoke each day and ran about on their moving feet in a rending subcutaneous adventure in that place of clay made fruit where her anatomical beauty had found its home in vain she struggled to chase those terrible creatures away she couldnt they were part of her own organism theyd been there alive since much before her physical existence they came from the heart of her father who had fed them painfully during his nights of desperate solitude or maybe they had poured into her arteries through the cord that linked her to her mother ever since the beginning of the world there was no doubt that those insects had not been born spontaneously inside her body she knew that they came from back there that all who bore her surname had to bear them had to suffer them as she did when insomnia held unconquerable sway until dawn it was those very insects who painted that bitter expression that unconsolable sadness on the faces of her forebears she had seen them looking out of their extinguished existence out of their ancient portraits victims of that same anguish she still remembered the disquieting face of the greatgrandmother who from her aged canvas begged for a minute of rest a second of peace from those insects who there in the channels of her blood kept on martyrizing her pitilessly beautifying her no those insects didnt belong to her they came transmitted from generation to generation sustaining with their tiny armor all the prestige of a select caste a painfully select group those insects had been born in the womb of the first woman who had had a beautiful daughter but it was necessary urgent to put a stop to that heritage someone must renounce the eternal transmission of that artificial beauty it was no good for women of her breed to admire themselves as they came back from their mirrors if during the night those creatures did their slow effective ceaseless work with a constancy of centuries it was no longer beauty it was a sickness that had to be halted that had to be cut off in some bold and radical wayshe still remembered the endless hours spent on that bed sown with hot needles those nights when she tried to speed time along so that with the arrival of daylight the beasts would stop hurting her what good was beauty like that night after night sunken in her desperation she thought it would have been better for her to have been an ordinary woman or a man but that useless virtue was denied her fed by insects of remote origin who were hastening the irrevocable arrival of her death maybe she would have been happy if she had had the same lack of grace that same desolate ugliness as her czechoslovakian friend who had a dogs name she would have been better off ugly so that she could sleep peacefully like any other christianshe cursed her ancestors they were to blame for her insomnia they had transmitted that exact invariable beauty as if after death mothers shook and renewed their heads in order to graft them onto the trunks of their daughters it was as if the same head a single head had been continuously transmitted with the same ears the same nose the identical mouth with its weighty intelligence to all the women who were to receive it irremediably like a painful inheritance of beauty it was there in the transmission of the head that the eternal microbe that came through across generations had been accentuated had taken on personality strength until it became an invincible being an incurable illness which upon reaching her after having passed through a complicated process of judgment could no longer be borne and was bitter and painful    just like a tumor or a cancerit was during those hours of wakefulness that she remembered the things disagreeable to her fine sensibility she remembered the objects that made up the sentimental universe where as in a chemical stew those microbes of despair had been cultivated during those nights with her big round eyes open and frightened she bore the weight of the darkness that fell upon her temples like molten lead everything was asleep around her and from her corner in order to bring on sleep she tried to go back over her childhood memoriesbut that remembering always ended with a terror of the unknown always after wandering through the dark corners of the house her thoughts would find themselves face to face with fear then the struggle would begin the real struggle against three unmovable enemies she would neverno she would neverbe able to shake the fear from her head she would have to bear it as it clutched at her throat and all just to live in that ancient mansion to sleep alone in that corner away from the rest of the worldher thoughts always went down along the damp dark passageways shaking the dry cobwebcovered dust off the portraits that disturbing and fearsome dust that fell from above from the place where the bones of her ancestors were falling apart invariably she remembered the boy she imagined him there sleepwalking under the grass in the courtyard beside the orange tree a handful of wet earth in his mouth she seemed to see him in his clay depths digging upward with his nails his teeth fleeing the cold that bit into his back looking for the exit into the courtyard through that small tunnel where they had placed him along with the snails in winter she would hear him weeping with his tiny sob mudcovered drenched with rain she imagined him intact just as they had left him five years before in that waterfilled hole she couldnt think of him as having decomposed on the contrary he was probably most handsome sailing along in that thick water as on a voyage with no escape or she saw him alive but frightened afraid of feeling himself alone buried in such a somber courtyard she herself had been against their leaving him there under the orange tree so close to the house she was afraid of him she knew that on nights when insomnia hounded her he would sense it he would come back along the wide corridors to ask her to stay with him ask her to defend him against those other insects who were eating at the roots of his violets he would come back to have her let him sleep beside her as he did when he was alive she was afraid of feeling him beside her again after he had leaped over the wall of death she was afraid of stealing those hands that the boy would always keep closed to warm up his little piece of ice she wished after she saw him turned into cement like the statue of fear fallen in the mud she wished that they would take him far away so that she wouldnt remember him at night and yet they had left him there where he was imperturbable now wretched feeding his blood with the mud of earthworms and she had to resign herself to seeing him return from the depths of his shadows because always invariably when she lay awake she began to think about the boy who must be calling her from his piece of earth to help him flee that absurd deathbut now in her new life temporal and spaceless she was more tranquil she knew that outside her world there everything would keep going on with the same rhythm as before that her room would still be sunken in earlymorning darkness and her things her furniture her thirteen favorite books all in place and that on her unoccupied bed the body aroma that filled the void of what had been a whole woman was only now beginning to evaporate but how could that happen how could she after being a beautiful woman her blood peopled by insects pursued by the fear of the total night have the immense wakeful nightmare now of entering a strange unknown world where all dimensions had been eliminated she remembered that nightthe night of her passagehad been colder than usual and she was alone in the house martyrized by insomnia no one disturbed the silence and the smell that came from the garden was a smell of fear sweat broke out on her body as if the blood in her arteries were pouring out its cargo of insects she wanted someone to pass by on the street someone who would shout would shatter that halted atmosphere for something to move in nature for the earth to move around the sun again but it was uselessthere was no waking up even for those imbecilic men who had fallen asleep under her ear inside the pillow she too was motionless the walls gave off a strong smell of fresh paint that thick grand smell that you dont smell with your nose but with your stomach and on the table the single clock pounding on the silence with its mortal machinery time    oh time she sighed remembering death and there in the courtyard under the orange tree the boy was still weeping with his tiny sob from the other worldshe took refuge in all her beliefs why didnt it dawn right then and there or why didnt she die once and for all she had never thought that beauty would cost her so many sacrifices at that momentas usualit still pained her on top of her fear and underneath her fear those implacable insects were still martyrizing her death had squeezed her into life like a spider biting her in a rage ready to make her succumb but the final moment was taking its time her hands those hands that men squeezed like imbeciles with manifest animal nervousness were motionless paralyzed by fear by that irrational terror that came from within with no motive just from knowing that she was abandoned in that ancient house she tried to react and couldnt fear had absorbed her completely and remained there fixed tenacious almost corporeal as if it were some invisible person who had made up his mind not to leave her room and the most upsetting part was that the fear had no justification at all that it was a unique fear without any reason a fear just becausethe saliva had grown thick on her tongue that hard gum that stuck to her palate and flowed because she was unable to contain it was bothersome between her teeth it was a desire that was quite different from thirst a superior desire that she was feeling for the first time in her life for a moment she forgot about her beauty her insomnia and her irrational fear she didnt recognize herself for an instant she thought that the microbes had left her body she felt that theyd come out stuck to her saliva yes that was all very fine it was fine that the insects no longer occupied her and that she could sleep now but she had to find a way to dissolve that resin that dulled her tongue if she could only get to the pantry and    but what was she thinking about she gave a start of surprise shed never felt that desire the urgency of the acidity had debilitated her rendering useless the discipline that she had faithfully followed for so many years ever since the day they had buried the boy it was foolish but she felt revulsion about eating an orange she knew that the boy had climbed up to the orange blossoms and that the fruit of next autumn would be swollen with his flesh cooled by the coolness of his death no she couldnt eat them she knew that under every orange tree in the world there was a boy buried sweetening the fruit with the lime of his bones nevertheless she had to eat an orange now it was the only thing for that gum that was smothering her it was the foolishness to think that the boy was inside a fruit she would take advantage of that moment in which beauty had stopped paining her to get to the pantry but wasnt that strange it was the first time in her life that shed felt a real urge to eat an orange she became happy happy oh what pleasure eating an orange she didnt know why but shed never had such a demanding desire she would get up happy to be a normal woman again singing merrily until she got to the pantry singing merrily like a new woman newborn she would even get to the courtyard and   her memory was suddenly cut off she remembered that she had tried to get up and that she was no longer in her bed that her body had disappeared that her thirteen favorite books were no longer there that she was no longer she now that she was bodiless floating drifting over an absolute nothingness changed into an amorphous dot tiny lacking direction she was unable to pinpoint what had happened she was confused she just had the sensation that someone had pushed her into space from the top of a precipice she felt changed into an abstract imaginary being she felt changed into an in corporeal woman something like her suddenly having entered that high and unknown world of pure spiritsshe was afraid again but it was a different fear from what she had felt a moment before it was no longer the fear of the boy s weeping it was a terror of the strange of what was mysterious and unknown in her new world and to think that all of it had happened so innocently with so much naivete on her part what would she tell her mother when she told her what had happened when she got home she began to think about how alarmed the neighbors would be when they opened the door to her bedroom and discovered that the bed was empty that the locks had not been touched that no one had been able to enter or to leave and that nonetheless she wasnt there she imagined her mothers desperate movements as she searched through the room conjecturing wondering what could have become of that girl the scene was clear to her the neighbors would arrive and begin to weave comments togethersome of them maliciousconcerning her disappearance each would think according to his own and particular way of thinking each would try to offer the most logical explanation the most acceptable at least while her mother would run along all the corridors in the big house desperate calling her by nameand there she would be she would contemplate the moment detail by detail from a corner from the ceiling from the chinks in the wall from anywhere from the best angle shielded by her bodiless state in her spacelessness it bothered her thinking about it now she realized her mistake she wouldnt be able to give any explanation clear anything up console anybody no living being could be informed of her transformation nowperhaps the only time that she needed themshe wouldnt have a mouth arms so that everybody could know that she was there in her corner separated from the threedimensional world by an unbridgeable distance in her new life she was isolated completely prevented from grasping emotions but at every moment something was vibrating in her a shudder that ran through her overwhelming her making her aware of that other physical universe that moved outside her world she couldnt hear she couldnt see but she knew about that sound and that sight and there in the heights of her superior world she began to know that an environment of anguish surrounded herjust a moment beforeaccording to our temporal worldshe had made the passage so that only now was she beginning to know the peculiarities the characteristics of her new world around her an absolute radical darkness spun how long would that darkness last would she have to get used to it for eternity her anguish grew from her concentration as she saw herself sunken in that thick impenetrable fog could she be in limbo she shuddered she remembered everything she had heard about limbo if she really was there floating beside her were other pure spirits those of children who had died without baptism who had been dying for a thousand years in the darkness she tried to find next to her those beings who must have been much purer ever so much simpler than she completely isolated from the physical world condemned to a sleepwalking and eternal life maybe the boy was there looking for an exit that would lead him to his bodybut no why should she be in limbo had she died perhaps no it was simply a change in state a normal passage from the physical world to an easier uncomplicated world where all dimensions had been eliminatednow she would not have to bear those subterranean insects her beauty had collapsed on her now in that elemental situation she could be happy althoughohnot completely happy because now her greatest desire the desire to eat an orange had become impossible it was the only thing that might have caused her still to want to be in her first life to be able to satisfy the urgency of the acidity that still persisted after the passage she tried to orient herself so as to reach the pantry and feel if nothing else the cool and sour company of the oranges it was then that she discovered a new characteristic of her world she was everywhere in the house in the courtyard on the roof even in the boys orange tree she was in the whole physical world there beyond and yet she was nowhere she became upset again she had lost control over herself now she was under a superior will she was a useless being absurd good for nothing without knowing why she began to feel sad she almost began to feel nostalgia for her beauty for the beauty that had foolishly ruined herbut one supreme idea reanimated her hadnt she heard perhaps that pure spirits can penetrate any body at will after all what harm was there in trying she attempted to remember what inhabitant of the house could be put to the proof if she could fulfill her aim she would be satisfied she could eat the orange she remembered at that time the servants were usually not there her mother still hadnt arrived but the need to eat an orange joined now to the curiosity of seeing herself incarnate in a body different from her own obliged her to act at once and yet there was no one there in whom she could incarnate herself it was a desolating bit of reason there was nobody in the house she would have to live eternally isolated from the outside world in her undimensional world unable to eat the first orange and all because of a foolish thing it would have been better to go on bearing up for a few more years under that hostile beauty and not wipe herself out forever making herself useless like a conquered beast but it was too lateshe was going to withdraw disappointed into a distant region of the universe to a place where she could forget all her earthly desires but something made her suddenly hold back the promise of a better future had opened up in her unknown region yes there was someone in the house in whom she could reincarnate herself the cat then she hesitated it was difficult to resign herself to live inside an animal she would have soft white fur and a great energy for a leap would probably be concentrated in her muscles and she would feel her eyes glow in the dark like two green coals and she would have white sharp teeth to smile at her mother from her feline heart with a broad and good animal smile but no it couldnt be she imagined herself quickly inside the body of the cat running through the corridors of the house once more managing four uncomfortable legs and that tail would move on its own without rhythm alien to her will what would life look like through those green and luminous eyes at night she would go to mew at the sky so that it would not pour its moonlit cement down on the face of the boy who would be on his back drinking in the dew maybe in her status as a cat she would also feel fear and maybe in the end she would be unable to eat the orange with that carnivorous mouth a coldness that came from right then and there born of the very roots of her spirit quivered in her memory no it was impossible to incarnate herself in the cat she was afraid of one day feeling in her palate in her throat in all her quadruped organism the irrevocable desire to eat a mouse probably when her spirit began to inhabit the cats body she would no longer feel any desire to eat an orange but the repugnant and urgent desire to eat a mouse she shuddered on thinking about it caught between her teeth after the chase she felt it struggling in its last attempts at escape trying to free itself to get back to its hole again no anything but that it was preferable to stay there for eternity in that distant and mysterious world of pure spiritsbut it was difficult to resign herself to live forgotten forever why did she have to feel the desire to eat a mouse who would rule in that synthesis of woman and cat would the primitive animal instinct of the body rule or the pure will of the woman the answer was crystal clear there was no reason to be afraid she would incarnate herself in the cat and would eat her desired orange besides she would be a strange being a cat with the intelligence of a beautiful woman she would be the center of all attention    it was then for the first time that she understood that above all her virtues what was in command was the vanity of a metaphysical womanlike an insect on the alert which raises its antennae she put her energy to work throughout the house in search of the cat it must still be on top of the stove at that time dreaming that it would wake up with a sprig of heliotrope between its teeth but it wasnt there she looked for it again but she could no longer find the stove the kitchen wasnt the same the corners of the house were strange to her they were no longer those dark corners full of cobwebs the cat was nowhere to be found she looked on the roof in the trees in the drains under the bed in the pantry she found everything confused where she expected to find the portraits of her ancestors again she found only a bottle of arsenic from there on she found arsenic all through the house but the cat had disappeared the house was no longer the same as before what had happened to her things why were her thirteen favorite books now covered with a thick coat of arsenic she remembered the orange tree in the courtyard she looked for it and tried to find the boy again in his pit of water but the orange tree wasnt in its place and the boy was nothing now but a handful of arsenic mixed with ashes underneath a heavy concrete platform now she really was going to sleep everything was different and the house had a strong smell of arsenic that beat on her nostrils as if from the depths of a pharmacyonly then did she understand that three thousand years had passed since the day she had had a desire to eat the first orange"

think he was a wacko or pervert and if he didnt smile they might think he was an old grouch made bitter by the world which surely he felt by certain yardsticks he was sometimes he wasnt entirely sure that he wasnt even a wacko of sorts although certainly he wasnt a pervert of that he was certain or relatively certain being overly certain he was relatively sure was what eventually made one a wacko so humility was the thing he thought arranging his face into what he thought would pass for the expression of a man thinking fondly of his own youth a face devoid of wackiness or perversion humility was the thingthe school sat among maples on a hillside that sloped down to the wide taganac river which narrowed and picked up speed and crashed over bryce falls a mile downstream near morses small rental house his embarrassingly small rental house actually which nevertheless was the best he could do and for which he knew he should be grateful although at times he wasnt a bit grateful and wondered where hed gone wrong although at other times he was quite pleased with the crooked little blue shack covered with peeling lead paint and felt great pity for the poor stiffs renting hazardous shitholes even smaller than his hazardous shithole which was how he felt now as he came down into the bright sunlight and continued his pleasant walk home along the green river lined with expensive mansions whose owners he deeply resentedmorse was tall and thin and as gray and sepulchral as a church about to be condemned his pants were too short and his face periodically broke into a tense involuntary grin that quickly receded as if he had just suffered a sharp pain at work he was known to punctuate his conversations with brief wild laughs and gusts of inchoate enthusiasm and subsequent embarrassment expressed by a sudden plunging of his hands into his pockets after which he would yank his hands out of his pockets too ashamed of his own shame to stand there merely grimacing for even an instant longerfrom behind him on the path came a series of arrhythmic whacking steps he glanced back to find aldo cummings an odd duck who though nearly forty still lived with his mother cummings didnt work and had his bangs cut straight across and wore gym shorts even in the dead of winter morse hoped cummings wouldnt collar him when cummings didnt collar him and in fact passed by without even returning his nervous selfeffacing grin morse felt guilty for having suspected cummings of wanting to collar him then miffed that cummings who collared even the cityhall cleaning staff hadnt tried to collar him had he done something to offend cummings it worried him that cummings might not like him and it worried him that he was worried about whether a nut like cummings liked him was he some kind of worrywart it worried him why should he be worried when all he was doing was going home to enjoy his beautiful children without a care in the world although on the other hand there was roberts piano recital which was sure to be a disaster since robert never practiced and they had no piano and werent even sure where of when the recital was and annie god bless her had eaten the cardboard keyboard hed made for robert to practice on when he got home he would make robert a new cardboard keyboard and beg him to practice he might even order him to practice he might even order him to make his own cardboard keyboard then practice although this was unlikely because when he became forceful with robert robert blubbered and morse loved robert so much he couldnt stand to see him blubbering although if he didnt become forceful with robert robert tended to lie on his bed with his baseball glove over his facegood god but life could be less than easy not that he was unaware that it could certainly be a lot worse but to go about in such a state pulse high face red worried sick that someone would notice how nervous one was was certainly less than ideal and he felt sure that his body was secreting all kinds of harmful chemicals and that the more he worried about the harmful chemicals the faster they were pouring out of wherever it was they came fromwhen he got home he would sit on the steps and enjoy a few minutes of centered breathing while reciting his mantra which was calm down calm down before the kids came running out and grabbed his legs and sometimes even bit him quite hard in their excitement and ruth came out to remind him in an angry tone that he wasnt the only one whod worked all day and as he walked he gazed out at the beautiful taganac in an effort to absorb something of her serenity but instead found himself obsessing about the faulty hatch on the gate which theoretically could allow annie to toddle out of the yard and into the river and he pictured himself weeping on the shore and to eradicate this thought started manically whistling the stars and stripes forever while slapping his hands against his sidescummings bobbed past the restored gristmill pleased at having so decisively snubbed morse a smug member of the power elite in the conspiratorial village one of the league of oppressive oppressors who wouldnt know the lot of the struggling artist if the lot of the struggling artist came up with great and beleaguered dignity and bit him on the polyester ass over the pen street bridge was a fat cloud to an interviewer in his head cummings said he felt the possible rain made the fine bright day even finer and brighter because of the possibility of its loss the possibility of its ephemeral loss the ephemeral loss of the day to the fleeting passages of time preening time preening nascent time the blackguard time made wastrels of us all did it not with its gaunt cheeks and its tombly reverberations and its admonishing glances with bony fingers bony fingers pointed as if in admonishment as if to say i admonish you to recall your own eventual nascent death which being on its way is forthcoming forthcoming mortal coil and dont think its ghastly pall wont settle on your furrowed brow pronto once i select your fated number from my very dusty book with the selfsame bony finger with which im pointing at you now you vanity of vanities you luster you shirker of duties as you shuffle after your worldly pleasured centersthat was some good stuff if only he could remember it through the rest of his stroll and the coming storm to scrawl in a passionate hand in his yellow pad he thought with longing ardor of his blank yellow pad he thought he thought with longing ardor of his blank yellow pad on which this selfsame day his fame would be wrought no on which this selfsame day the first meager scrawlings which would presage his nascent burgeoning fame would be wrought or rather writ and someday someone would dig up his yellow pad and virtually cry eureka when they realized what a teeming fragment of minutiae and yet crucial minutiae had been found and wouldnt all kinds of literary women in short black jackets want to meet him thenin the future he must always remember to bring his pad everywherethe town had spent a mint on the riverfront and now the burbling smashing taganac ran past a nail salon in a restored gristmill and a cafe in a former coal tower and a quaint public square where some highschool boys with odd haircuts were trying to kick a soccer ball into the partly open window of a parked colt with a joy so belligerent and obnoxious that it seemed they believed themselves the first boys ever to walk the face of the earth while morse found worrisome what if annie grew up and brought one of these freaks home not one of these exact freaks of course since they were approximately fifteen years her senior although it was possible that at twenty she could bring home on of these exact freaks who would then be approximately thirtyfive albeit over morses dead body although in his heart he knew he wouldnt make a stink about it even if she did bring home one the freaky snots who had just succeeded in kicking the ball into the colt and were now jumping around joyfully bumping their bare chests together while grunting like walruses and in fact he knew perfectly well that rather than expel the thirtyfiveyearold freak from his home he would likely offer him coffee or a soft drink in an attempt to dissuade him from corrupting annie who for gods sake was just a baby because morse knew very well the kind of man he was at heart timid of conflict conciliatory to a fault pathetically gullible and with a pang he remember len beck who senior year had tricked him into painting his ass blue if there had actually been a secret blueassers club if the asspainting had in fact been required for membership it would have been bad enough but to find out on the eve of ones prom that one had painted ones ass blue simply for the amusement of a clique of unfeeling swimmers who subsequently supplied certain photographs to ones prom date that was too much and he had been glad quite glad actually at least at first when beck drunk had tried and failed to swim to foleys snag and been swept over the falls in the dark of night the great tragedy of their senior year a tragedy that had mercifully eclipsed morses blue ass in the classs collective memorytwo redheaded girls sailed by in a green canoe drifting with the current they yelled something to him and he waved had they yelled something insulting certainly it was possible certainly todays children had no respect for authority although one had to admit there was always ben akbar their neighbor a little pakistani genius who sometimes made morse look askance at robert ben was an allstate cellist on the wrestling team who was unfailingly sweet to smaller kids and tolepainted and could do a onehanded pushup ah ben shmen morse thought ten bens werent worth a single robert although he couldnt think of one area in which robert was superior or even equal to ben the little smartypants although certainly he had nothing against ben being a mere boy but if ben thought for a minute that his being more accomplished and friendly and talented than robert somehow entitled him to lord it over robert ben had another think coming not that ben had ever actually lorded it over robert on the contrary robert often lorded it over ben or tried to although he always failed because ben was too sharp to be taken in by a little con man like robert and morses face reddened at the realization that he had just characterized his own son as a con manboy oh boy could life be a torture could life ever force a fellow into a strange dark place from which he found himself doing graceless unforgivable things like casting aspersions on his beloved firstborn if only he could escape blascorp and do something significant such as discovering a critical vaccine but it was too late and he had never been good at biology and in fact had flunked it twice but some kind of moment in the sun would certainly not be unwelcome if only he could be a tortured prisoner of war who not only refused to talk but led the other prisoners in rousing hymns at great personal risk if only he could witness an actual miracle or save the president from an assassin or win the lotto and give it all to charity if only he could be part of some great historical event like the codgers he saw on pbs who had been slugged in the haymarket riot or known medgar evers or lost beautific mothers on the titanic his childhood dreams had been so bright he had hoped for so much it couldnt be true that he was a nobody although on the other hand what kind of somebody spends the best years of his life swearing at a photocopier not that he was complaining not that he was unaware he had plenty to be thankful for he loved his children he loved the way ruth looked in bed by candlelight when he had wedged the laundry basket against the door that wouldnt shut because the house was settling alarmingly loved the face she made when he entered her love the way she made light of the blueass story although he didnt particularly love that she sometimes trotted it out when they were fightingfor example on the dreadful night when the piano had been repossessedor the way she blamed his passivity for their poverty within earshot of the kids or the fact that at the height of her infatuation with roberts karate instructor master li she had been dragging robert to class as often as six times a week the poor little exhausted guy but the point was in spite of certain difficulties he truly loved ruth so what if their bodies were failing and fattening and they undressed in the dark and robert admired strapping athletes on television while looking askance at morses rounded pimpled back it didnt matter because someday when robert had a rounded pimpled back of his own he would appreciate his father who had subjugated his petty personal desires for the good of his family although god willing robert would have a decent career by then and could afford to join a gym and see a dermatologistand morse stopped in his tracks wondering what in the world two little girls were doing alone in a canoe speeding toward the falls apparently oarlesscummings walked along gazing into a mythic dusky arboreal wood that put him in mind of the archetypal vision he had numbered 114 in his book of archetypal visions on which mom that nitwit had recently spilled grape pop vision 114 concerned standing on the edge of an ancient dense wood at twilight with the safe harbor of ones abode behind and the deep wild ahead replete with dark fearsome bears looming from albeit dingy covens what would that twitching nervous wage slave morse think if he were to dip his dim brow into the heady brew that was the archetypal visions morse ha cummings thought im glad im not morse a dullard in corporate pants trudging home to his threadbare brats in the gathering loam born like the rest of his ilk with their feet of clay thrust down the maw of conventionality content to cheerfully work lemminglike in moribund cubicles while comparing their stocks and bonds between bouts of tedious lawn mowing then chortling while holding their suckling brats to the nintendo beast that was a powerful image cummings thought one that he might develop some brooding night into a herculean prome that some hollywood smoothie would eat like a hotcake so he could buy mom a lexus and go with someone leggy and blousy to paris after taking some time to build up his body with arm curls so as to captivate her physically as well as mentally and in paris the leggy girl in perhaps tight leather pants would sit on an oldtime bed with a beautiful shawl or blanket around her shoulders and gaze at him with doe eyes as he stood on the balcony brooding about the parisian rain and so forth and wouldnt morse and his ilk stew in considerable juice when he sent home a postcard just to be niceand wouldnt the village fall before him on repentant knees when tshirts imprinted with his hardwon visage his heraldic leonine visage one might say were available to all at the fiveanddime and he held court on the porch in a white whitmanesque suit while mom hovered behind him getting everything wrong about his work and profering inane snacks to his manifold admirers and wouldnt revenge be sent when such former football players as ned wentz began begging him for lessons in the sonnet and all that was required for these things to come to pass was some paper and pens and a quixotic blathering talent the likes of which would not be seen again soon the critics would write all of which he had in spades and he rounded the last bend before the falls euphoric with his own possibilities and saw a canoe the color of summer leaves ram the steep upstream wall of the snag the girls inside were thrown forward and shrieked with open mouths over frothing waves that would not let them be heard as the boat split open along some kind of seam and began taking on water in doomful fast quantities cummings stood stunned his body electrified hairs standing up on the back of his craning neck thinking i must do something their faces are bloody but what such fast cold water still i must do something and he stumbled over the berm uncertainly looking for help but finding only a farm field of tall dry cornmorse began to run in all probability this was silly in all probability the girls were safe onshore or if not help was already on its way although certainly it was possible that the girls were not safe onshore and help was not on its way and in fact it was even possible that the help that was on its way was him which was worrisome because he had never been good under pressure and in a crisis often stood mentally debating possible options with his mouth hanging open come to think of it it was possible even probable that the boat had already gone over the falls or hit the snag he remembered the crew of the barge fat chance rescued via rope bridge in the early carter years he hoped several sweaty decisive men were already on the scene and that one of them would send him off to make a phone call although what if on the way he forgot the phone number and had to go back and ask the sweaty decisive man to repeat it and what if this failure got back to ruth and she was filled with shame and divorced him and forbade him to see the kids who didnt want to see him anyway because he was such a panicky screwup this was certainly not positive thinking this was certainly an example of predestining failure via negativity because who could tell maybe he would stand in line assisting the decisive men and incur a nasty rope burn and go home a hero wearing a bandage which might cause ruth to regard him in a more favorable sexual light and they would stay up all night celebrating his new manhood and exchanging sweet words between bouts of energetic lovemaking although what kind of thing was that to be thinking at a time like this with childrens lives at stake he was bad that was for sure there wasnt an earnest bone in his body other people were simpler and looked at the world with clearer eyes but he was selfabsorbed and insincere and mucked everything up and he hoped this wasnt one more thing he was destined to muck up because mucking up a rescue was altogether different from forgetting to mail out the invitations to your sons birthday party which he had recently done although certainly they had spent a small fortune rectifying the situation stopping just short of putting an actual pony on visa but the point was this was serious and he had to bear down and throwing his thin legs out ahead of him awkwardly bent at the waist shirttails trailing behind and bum knee hurting he remonstrated with himself to put aside all selfdoubt and negativity and prepare to assist the decisive men in whatever way he could once he had rounded the bend and assessed the situationbut when he rounded the bend and assessed the situation he found no rope bridge or decisive men only a canoe coming apart at the base of the snag and two small girls in matching sweaters trying to bail with a bait bucket what to do this was a shocker go for help sprint to the outlet mall and call 911 from knife world there was no time the canoe was sinking before his eyes the girls would be drowned before he reached route 8 could one swim to the snag certainly one could not no one ever had was he a good swimmer he was mediocre at best therefore he would have to run for help but running was futile because there was no time he had just decided that and swimming was out of the question therefore the girls would die they were basically dead although that couldnt be that was too sad what would become of the mother who this morning had dressed them in matching sweaters how would she cope soon her girls would be nude and bruised and dead on a table it was unthinkable he thought of robert nude and bruised and dead on a table what to do he fiercely wished himself elsewhere the girls saw him now and with their hands appeared to be trying to explain that they would be dead soon my god did they think he was blind did they think he was stupid was he their father did they think he was christ they were dead they were frantic calling out to him but they were dead as dead as the ancient dead and he was alive he was needed at home it was a nobrainer no one could possible blame him for his one and making a low sound of despair in his throat he kicked off his loafers and threw his long ugly body out across the water"
